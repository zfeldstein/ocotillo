Mars's atmosphere is about 100 times thinner than Earth's. Without a "thermal blanket,"
can't retain any heat energy. On average, the temperature on Mars is about ahrenheit (minus 60 degrees Celsius). In winter, near the poles temperatures can get down to minus 195 degrees F (minus 125 degrees C). A summer day on Mars may get up to 70 degrees F (20 degrees C) near the equator, but at night the temperature can plummet to about minus 100 degrees F (minus 73 C).
NASA's Mars Curiosity rover measured air temperatures as high as 43 degrees F (6 degrees C) in the afternoon, with temperatures climbing above freezing for a significant number of days.
"That we are seeing temperatures this warm already during the day is a surprise and very interesting," Felipe GÃ³mez, of the Centro de Astrobiologia in Madrid, said in a .
Frost forms on the rocks at night, but as dawn approaches and the air gets warmer, the frost turns to vapor, and there is 100 percent humidity until it evaporates. The high humidity could help make Mars more habitable, if the water condenses to form short-term puddles in the early morning hours.
